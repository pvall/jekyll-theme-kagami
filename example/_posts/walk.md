Song: Walk by (Sandy) Alex G
title of this ish: running from something

A gunshot filled the air of the open field. 

Left foot, then right, avoid that rock, left, right, left, right. Alex was running for his life. 

His nipples were chafing slightly more than usual, but this was the start of a good race for Alex. The bright yellow, polyester uniforms he and his cross country teammates were forced to wear were far from flattering, and as a result of the aforementioned chafing, potentially lethal. 

Luckily, Alex had remembered to use the special Vaseline his mom had purchased for him -- obtained as the result of a rather awkward conversation for Alex. Alex resolved firmly: this was no time to be thinking about nipple chafing. 

Alex had an urgency about him; a newcomer to the cross country team, this was only his second race. His first, he came in last - dead last.  This would not happen again.

Left, right, remember to breathe, how does breathing work again, avoid that log, left, right. 

The start of the race saw Alex using a great deal of energy to distance himself from the back of the pack, while staying far away from those who actually had a shot to win the race. Alex did not know why, but this was not important.  His urgency went beyond the three medals given out at the end of the race  -- after all, they were not made out of chocolate. 

The park they were racing in would later become his favorite. It was a forgiving terrain to run on, no punishing hills or obstacle-laden paths, sitting in a park that people would genuinely come to. In this beautiful Fall scene, leaves on the ground, changing colors, and trees abound,  it was clear: place dogs just happened to defacate in. 

Left, right, left,  throat feels like a firehose, right. Submerged in this landscape, Alex pushed himself closer and closer to a feeling he imagined aligned with what death would feel like. 

He thought about death rather frequently, about every five minutes. When death left his mind, he remembered the path he was running on, harkening back to just a few weeks ago when, in relative boredom, he was not running at all -- not doing much of anything. 

Would he have preferred that? Coming home straight afterschool seemed an indulgence as sweet as a found-in-jeans-pocket Three Musketeers bar. He could go home, immediately turn on the TV ( Judge Judy),  pass out on the couch until his parents got home, just relax. Though Alex, panting with shins aching -- everything aching -- was thinking of this malaise laziness (malaiziness) romantically, he found it hard to convince himself that he'd rather be inside at this moment. 

The race continued, and Alex found his stride, as his throat stopped burning; or more possible, he just forgot about the sensation.  There were about sixty highschool-aged boys and girls running this race, but Alex could only see two others in his vicinity, one ahead of him and one behind him, with a fair amount of distance between. There was almost an understanding that the pecking order was set -- no one was going to make any sudden movements to overtake another, at least until the end of the race. 

Alex was comfortable with this situation; though cross country was an individual sport, he felt a kinship with the two others as they navigated the twists and turns of the course in his favorite park.

These sorts of nonverbal interactions were gratifying for Alex, who was suffering through what felt like a cramp coming into his upper thigh. In the months before, he viewed his life as  gray and unremarkable; he went to school, talked with his friends, and returned home, going to bed early in preparation to repeat again. The conversations he had with his friends seemed cyclical, the same sentiment time and again, with changing particulars. Though they weren't unpleasant interactions, they filled the well of Alex's metaphysical boredom, as with the rest of his daily activities. Just as well, his interactions with his family were more-or-less mundane. Nightly dinners saw his family around a circular table with seats for four: his parents, sister (just a year younger than Alex), and Alex, temporarily awoken from his nap. Alex usually complained, out loud or on his face, about the food, ate begrudgingly, and moved on. 

Alex and his sister didn't talk that much. He didn't think about her that much, either. Sometimes at night, he wished he did. Otherwise, he felt a small dose of shame passing her in the hallways, but partly wished her well each time, and moved on, eyes looking at something other than people, onward to .. some shit.  

He now tried to fill in these gaps in his interactions by imagining what the runners near him might be like in person, partly to disctract from the feeling that his heart was an overfilled balloon.  

As it turned to dusk, and visibility was getting worse, he could still make out that the person ahead of him was from a neighboring town and about his age and height. His form was better than Alex's: he moved his arms a lot less like those an air filled plastic waving things at used car lots. Wacky inflatable flailing arm tube men, that was it.  He gave the person ahead a name, something generic, and pictured him going to class, or shooting a basketball, and mentally rounded out his personality until the exercise revealed its fictionality, and moving on to the next person. 

Despite taking several looks whenever possible, could not get a read on who was behind him. He was trying to maintain his position, breathing, and concentration, but as the race moved on, with just about a half mile left, Alex became increasingly impatient -- what was behind him? 

The pace picked up, but Alex kept trying to glance backward. Out of the corner of his eye, Alex caught a glimpse of something, something dark and black, a silhouette. 

Left, the fuck is that, right, left, right, left, right.

Alex tried to speculate and calm his mind -- it was probably a bird flying low or something like that -- he had only caught the slightest of glimspes.  The worry would not dissipate, spreading through his entire body like a fluid. He felt it in his stomach, in his legs, in his arms, everywhere, as he tightened up. Was it a gigantic spider? A disgusting and mutant sewer rat?  A scaly, venomous cobra?  

He felt what was behind him -- somewhere inside, beyond logic, beyond comparison. He couldn't reason with it, so he frantically continued down the path with an urgency unknown to him previously. 

_Alex was running from something. _

He entered a dense forestal area with a path through it, and was the only one there -- the runner above him had taken a more aggresive pace as the race was coming to a finish. He could see the finish line up ahead, out of the woods. 

He dug into the well once shut by boredom, and planted his feet firmer and firmer into the ground with each step. His breath was wild and chaotic, but under control, as with the rest of his body -- they were fine, unified, moving forward. He "kicked" using every ounce of fluid in that well, step by step, inching closer, trouble lurking behind. 

Ten more steps. Nine. Fucking go, forward, on, now. He felt like a rocket moving his fastest. Though his current pace was a highly average speed in the competition, he was pushing his limit with each violent, turbulent breath.

Six, five, four, three steps. Finish. Alex collapsed on the ground soon after the finish line, smiling for a second, having forgotten about what was chasing him. He basked in this moment, enjoying the sunshine and the chilly October breeze. 

This moment faded as he turned around to look, horrified in anticipation. There "it" was: his sister, wearing a black sheet with two eyes cut out as a low-effort Halloween costume for this, October 31-themed race. He exhaled a deep relief, smiling at the journey that got him to this point.

Upon looking further, he saw his sister moving with the same furious pace and concentration down through the forest and to the finish line. 

_She was running from something, too. _
